Getting Started
The os module is part of Python's standard library, so it is included with any Python distribution. To use the module, you simply need to import it:

python
Copy code
import os
File and Directory Operations
The os module provides a variety of functions for working with files and directories. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

os.getcwd() - returns the current working directory
os.chdir(path) - changes the current working directory to path
os.listdir(path) - returns a list of files and directories in the directory path
os.mkdir(path) - creates a new directory at path
os.makedirs(path) - creates a new directory and any necessary parent directories at path
os.rmdir(path) - removes the directory at path
os.removedirs(path) - removes the directory at path and any empty parent directories
Process Management
The os module provides several functions for working with processes:

os.fork() - creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, known as the child process, is an exact copy of the calling process.
os.execv(path, args) - replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by path. The arguments to the new process are passed in as a list in args.
os.wait() - waits for a child process to terminate and returns its exit status.
Environment Variables
The os module also provides functions for working with environment variables:

os.environ - a dictionary containing the environment variables for the current process
os.getenv(name, default) - returns the value of the environment variable name, or default if the variable is not set
os.putenv(name, value) - sets the value of the environment variable name to value
Conclusion
The os module provides a wide range of functionality for working with the operating system in Python. This readme provides an overview of some of the most commonly used functions, but there are many more available. Refer to the Python documentation for more detailed information on each function.
